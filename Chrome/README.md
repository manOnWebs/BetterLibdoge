license
-------------
Doge is licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) license because, well, Doge *willed* it so. 

Much freedom.
Do whatever you want with Doge!

what is this?
---------------

This is a modification of the [libdoge chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/libdoge/ifbchccfedjkkhlnffjckaghjdpchhmo?hl=en). It also has to support Manifest Version 3... because of the original developer abandoning the project and not having it updated at all...

Added:

1. service worker so that it's compatible with MV3.
2. some modifications to the dataminer. it now saves everything it mines to it's local storage. no, we don't save any of your data, it's all local


You can check the JavaScript if you don't believe me.
